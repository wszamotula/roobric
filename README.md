# roobric
Many high school English classrooms receive student paper submissions through Google Docs.  Teachers grade the paper using a rubric, also on Google Docs, and return the paper to the student.  Roobric is a Google Doc add-on that will improve the rubric grading process for high school English courses.  The add-on is being developed with the scrum framework using Scrumdesk and will be free to download from the Google App store. 

Teachers will use the add-on to link the associated rubric to a student’s paper.  The linked rubric and additional features will be available in a sidebar on the Google Doc.  After linking, they will be able to associate comments with rubric categories, fill out the rubric, convert the rubric grade to a percentage grade, and insert the completed rubric into the student’s paper.  Students will get a customized report used to review the results.  The report will display the rubric grades, and comments colored to emphasize which category they are linked to.
